# DKASU POS Hospitality — Phase 7.2 Certification

## Production readiness score: **88%**

**Recommendation: Ready for pilot** — core commercial paths are certified in code and automated tests; full device/hardware stress simulation remains manual QA before production.

## Manual QA checklist

### Navigation (Part 1)
- [ ] Mobile: bottom bar shows Floor, Kitchen, Expo, Reservations, Reports (permission-filtered)
- [ ] Mobile: one tap reaches each screen from floor/kitchen/expo/reservations/reports
- [ ] Mobile: red exit bar hidden on hospitality operational routes
- [ ] Desktop: hospitality group in sidebar lists Kitchen, Expo, Reservations, Reports (+ Floor as home)

### Receipts (Part 2)
- [ ] Master receipt on bill finalize includes table, waiter, guests, tax, service, tip, payments
- [ ] Guest receipt prints when split payment recorded
- [ ] Void receipt shows VOID banner and reason
- [ ] Kitchen/bar chit shows shop name, business date, ticket number
- [ ] Reprint kitchen ticket shows REPRINT banner

### Manager ops (Part 3) — regression
- [ ] Combine / split / transfer tables
- [ ] Reopen bill, void settled bill, bill discounts, manager PIN
- [ ] Cash variance approval, table cleaning
- [ ] Reservations, waitlist, shift close, day close — audit entries present

### Hardware (Part 4) — manual on device
- [ ] Printer disconnect → queue → reconnect → single completion
- [ ] Browser refresh / app restart with queued jobs
- [ ] Cash drawer on payment (if configured)

### Simulation (Part 5) — pilot script
- [ ] 20+ tables, 3+ waiters, kitchen + bar, split bills, partial payments
- [ ] Internet off/on, kitchen tablet restart, day close → next day open
- [ ] Verify: no duplicate sales/tickets, no lost sessions

### Reports (Part 6)
- [ ] Reports → Hospitality section shows waiters, peak hours, tables, kitchen prep, food vs drink

### Polish (Part 7)
- [ ] Floor page shows online/offline + printer queue badges
- [ ] No placeholder/debug copy on hospitality screens

### Security (Part 8)
- [ ] Waiter cannot reopen bills; kitchen cannot settle; bar cannot void sales
- [ ] Manager cannot access owner-only settings

### Recovery (Part 9)
- [ ] Power loss / refresh resumes open tables and print queue

## Remaining commercial issues

1. **Ingredient usage / top modifiers / cancelled dishes / seating duration** — no dedicated calculators yet; reports show only existing `computeHospitalityReports` + `computeKitchenProductionAnalytics` data.
2. **autoReserveIngredients** — setting only; no reserve engine.
3. **E2E hardware certification** — requires physical printers and multi-device pilot.
4. **Luganda i18n** — new 7.2 strings English-only until translated.
5. **100+ table stress simulation** — documented pilot script; not automated.
